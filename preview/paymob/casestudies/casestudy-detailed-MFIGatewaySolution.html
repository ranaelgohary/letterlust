                    <b>Case Study Name:</b> “MFI Gateway solution” allowing MFIs-to-person - loan disbursement - as well as person-to-MFIs - (loan collection - transactions via multiple mobile wallet issuers<br>
                    <b>Solution Providers:</b> Alexandria Business Association (ABA), Vodafone, Orange, Etisalat<br>
                    <b>Implementation Status:</b> Live<br><br>
                    <b>Current challenges in the market:</b><br><br>
                    The microfinance industry presents a clear opportunity to cater to the financial needs of unbanked and underbanked Egyptian entrepreneurs and small business owners. The lack of access to traditional banking services creates the need for alternative microcredit providers.
                    <br><br>
                    While microfinance has proven to be a successful tool for financial inclusion, several challenges currently inhibit the industry to further scale:
                    <br><br>
                    &#9675; Consumers are faced with high opportunity costs that are caused by limitations in withdrawing their loans as well as paying their installments physically in branch. These limitations include: transportation costs and loss of business.<br>
                    &#9675; As for MFIs, these institutions are faced with challenges in disbursement and collection operations and the high costs of logistics, cash management and running branches.<br>
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Solution Overview:</b><br><br>
                    Paymob’s MFI “Gateway solution” aims to provide an entry point for microfinance customers to get access to an increased range of financial services, by capitalising on mobile wallets. With more than 400,000 active borrowers across 7 governorates and more than 60 branches, Alexandria Businessmen Association (ABA) is the MFI in Egypt with the largest outreach in terms of number of customers. As of early 2019, ABA became the first MFI to launch a digital solution allowing their customers to receive loans and pay installments through mobile wallets. This solution was launched in partnership with Vodafone, Egypt’s leading mobile network operator. By providing the integration between the MNO and ABA, Paymob managed to automate the collection of loan installments for ABA through Vodafone.
                    <br><br>
                    The solution aims to provide added convenience to ABA customers, who will no longer need to visit ABA branches to pay their installments. In addition, Paymob’s “MFI Gateway” solution aims to empower consumers by giving them value-added tools to manage their loans, such as the ability to inquire about their due loan and pay it in a few clicks. . On the other hand, the solution provides ABA with more transparency through an instant view on the consumer credit situation and transactions, all while considerably decreasing operational costs.
                    <br><br>
                    Going forward, these customers will not only have access to microcredit services in a more convenient way, but also have the opportunity to get access to a continuously increasing range of services such as utility bill payments, airtime top-up payments, person-to-person transfers etc.
