                    <b>Solution Name:</b> Cashless Community<br>
                    <b>Case Study Name:</b> AUC Coin<br>
                    <b>Solution Provider:</b> American University of Cairo (AUC)<br>
                    <b>Implementation Status:</b> Launched in February 2018, AUC Coin is now used by the whole AUC community, students, faculty, & staff. Tens of thousands of transactions are performed across more than 40 payment outlets.<br><br>
                    <b>Current challenges in the market:</b><br><br>
                    In closed communities, there are handful of payment options available for customer usage. Most do not cater for the rising need of fast payment option serving the fast paced environments in educational institutes where time is of the essence. In fast paced communities, there are only short time spans for ordering food or beverages such that every minute saved means more customers get served. In addition, in communities heavily dependant on lower age groups tend to have an even lower bank penetration to cater for digital payments.
                    <br><br>
                    Moreover, Community managers do not have data insights on how this closed economy operates which limits their decision making capabilities in catering better services to the community. Finally, heavy dependence on cash makes operations slow and expensive due to the high logistics, staffing and indirect security and insurance costs associated with cash management.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Solution Overview:</b><br><br>
                    Paymob’s Cashless Community is a closed loop solution enabling users to charge wallet, perform purchase and refund transactions within a closed community while enabling administrators to have full visibility over all system activities for settlement and reconciliation purposes.
                    <br><br>
                    American University of Cairo (AUC) is the first university in Egypt to adopt the cashless initiative and apply it across all on campus across campus services and third-party outlets. In addition to developing and maintaining the cashless solution implemented on AUC premises, Paymob constantly works on developing and enhancing the campus payments experience and constantly works on adding different use cases to increase the ultimate benefit of the community. This implementation has proven the benefits and feasibility of such solution to other closed communities such as, schools, workspaces and other residential communities. Paymob was also instrumental in contributing to the design-thinking of the whole end-to-end experience catered for a better customer journey.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Benefits & Impact on financial inclusion:</b>
                    <br><br>
                    <b>&#9642; Risk:</b> Increase Campus Safety as Cashless minimizes the risk of robbery and fraud.<br>
                    <b>&#9642; Cost:</b> Cashless saves transportation, staffing and other indirect costs.<br>
                    <b>&#9642; Technology Opportunities:</b> Cashless payments on campuses leaves room for innovative technologies and services to be catered.<br>
                    <b>&#9642; Leadership:</b> AUC would maintain its position as the leading higher-education institution in the region.<br>
                    <b>&#9642; Revenue Opportunities:</b> Cashless increases spending habits and reduces which gives room for revenue generating opportunities.<br>
                    <b>&#9642; Education and Awareness:</b> Cashless payments within closed communities help raise awareness and educate younger generation of the benefits of digital financial services preparing them for real-life experience.
